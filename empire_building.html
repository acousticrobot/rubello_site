<h2>EMPIRE BUILDING.</h2>
<p>A high rise notable for its terra cotta facade and elaborate cornice, the <a href="http://historicdetroit.org/building/empire-building/">Empire </a>
 once stood two parcels north of the Julian C. Madison Building, at Clifford. It was designed by John Scott and built in 1908.</p>
<p>One reason that Rubello selects 1420 Washington for the site of <cite>Color Cubes</cite> is because he believes that the Empire Building will help protect his mural from the elements over time. It does so until the late 1990s, when it is razed for a parking lot.</p>

<p>In the photo above, the Empire Building (second from left) can be seen in relation to 1420 Washington (fourth from left, with the Robinson Furniture Company sign partially visible). The low-rise building between them is lost to fire in 1961 -- making the creation of <cite>Color Cubes</cite>, twelve years later, possible.<a href="references.html"><sup>2 </sup></a></p>
