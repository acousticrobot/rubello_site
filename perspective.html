<h2>PERSPECTIVE.</h2>
<p>In 1978, Rubello earns a Ford Foundation grant to spend five weeks in Italy studying the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective </a>
. Upon his return to the US, he begins considering the possibility that paintings might actually "come out from the wall." <cite>Blue Cut</cite>, a turning point in his career, is the first work he paints with this idea in mind.</p>

<p>After making a first, more painterly pass at the canvas, Rubello writes that he "broke up the atmospheric space and initiated a pure sky blue rectangle at the top right hand corner....This presented an implied separation from the picture plane. The blue rectangle created a blue cut interrupting the two dimensional plane. This pure color opposed the rest of the painting."<a href="references.html"><sup>13 </sup></a></p>
<p><cite>Blue Cut</cite> advances Rubello's concern with the relationships between geometric forms evident in his earlier, hard-edge paintings, like <cite>Color Cubes</cite>; it also anticipates his venture, three years later, into literal three-dimensionality.</p>
<p>"In about 1981," he says, "I began to leave painting. I thought, 'Well, the next move has to be out from the wall. It has to be out from the canvas. And instead of making it illusionistic [as in Blue Cut], I should actually do it. It should be color in space.' So I started constructing these things, making these paintings that were dimensional. I called it 'actual space.'"</p>

<p>Rubello's turn toward "dimensional paintings" opens up the possibility of working with reflected color and movable paintings. It also provides new opportunities to engage in illusionistic play; often, his dimensional pieces contain brilliant, saturated colors that are invisible from certain perspectives, revealed only after the viewer has physically moved around the work.</p>
