<h2>MESSAGE TO DEMAR AND LAURI.</h2>
<p>The first large-scale geometric mural to decorate a building in downtown Detroit, <cite>Message to Demar and Lauri</cite> is commissioned by the nonprofit Art for Detroit, funded by Detroit Renaissance, designed by Alan Loving (Rubello's classmate at Cass Tech) and painted on an expansive, east-facing back wall of the First National Building in 1971.</p>

<p>Covering 20,000 square feet, it is referred to in 1971 by Frank Kolbert, a member of Art for Detroit and a representative of the DIA, as "the largest painting of its kind in the world."<a href="references.html"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
