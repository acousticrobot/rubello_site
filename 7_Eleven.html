<h2>7-ELEVEN.</h2>
<p>In April 2014, the first 7-Eleven store to operate in Detroit in eleven years opens on Jefferson Ave., east of downtown. In anticipation of its opening and the subsequent opening of a second store downtown, large banner ads featuring photo collages of different animals wearing Slurpee mustache straws appear on several downtown buildings, including one, featuring a cat, on the north exterior wall of the Julian C. Madison Building, 1420 Washington Blvd.</p>

<p>Before the ad's installation, <cite>Color Cubes</cite>, painted on the same wall in 1973, is painted over.</p>

 and <a href="http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/9494/a_sign_of_the_times_this_7-eleven_cat_vs_that_1973_mural">Deadline Detroit </a>
 both run stories over the next few days musing about the new ad versus the old mural, with Ben Duell Fraser wondering in Deadline Detroit, "So, have we lost a piece of our history, a slice of our culture? Is that what progress is about? Or does this indicate that Detroit is rejoining the ranks of cities with a downtown worth advertising on, and worth advertising to?"</p>
<p>The ad remains on the wall for just a few months. Its removal reveals a four story, grey-brown rectangle where <cite>Color Cubes</cite> used to be.</p>
