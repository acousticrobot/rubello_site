<h2>7-ELEVEN.</h2>
<p>In April 2014, the first 7-Eleven store to operate in Detroit in eleven years opens on Jefferson Ave., east of downtown. In anticipation of its opening and the subsequent opening of a second store downtown, large banner ads featuring photo collages of different animals wearing Slurpee mustache straws appear on several downtown buildings, including one, featuring a cat, on the north exterior wall of 1420 Washington.</p>

<p>Before the ad's installation, <cite>Color Cubes</cite> is painted over. The ad remains on the wall for just a few months. Its removal reveals the four story grey-brown rectangle (the void) that has replaced the mural.</p>
