<h2>ART APPRECIATION.</h2>
<p>To Rubello, a higher pursuit than art criticism. While the latter is a conversation between specialists, the former concerns the non-artist, the non-critic -- who too must live with art.</p>
<img src="img/Art_Appreciation.jpg" alt="Art_Appreciation"><div class=" image-caption">From the Detroit Free Press, August 14, 1974</div>
<p>In 1965, Detroit gallery owner Gertrude Kasle (who later co-directs Living With Art, the program that results in the creation of <cite>Color Cubes</cite> and at least 11 other murals and public sculptures in Detroit) writes in the <cite>Detroit News</cite>:</p>
<p><blockquote>The art of today demands an educated eye. "Seeing" is so common that it is frequently confused with informed looking. If you bring something of yourself to this art, if you are willing to grow with it, exchange old values and concepts for new ones, the rewards will be great. Your life will become enriched with an understanding and an appreciation of our own times. Everything around you will take on another dimension.<a href="references.html"><sup>7 </sup></a></blockquote></p>
