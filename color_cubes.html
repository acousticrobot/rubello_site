<h2><cite>COLOR CUBES</cite></h2>
<p>(a). <cite></cite> Rubello's 50' x 25' mural is commissioned by New Detroit, Inc. in 1972 as part of its "Living with Art" initiative and executed over the course of one week in 1973 by two sign painters from the Le Mans Sign Company under the artist's supervision. It is painted over in May, 2014 after years of fading and wear.</p>

<p>Upon selecting the site for his mural and considering an appropriate design, Rubello revisits an earlier screenprint, Poetry of Space, and doubles it along its vertical axis. See <a href="living_with_art.html"> Living With Art</a>.</p>

<p><cite>Color Cubes</cite> is described by Dennis Nawrocki in the book <cite>Art in Public Places</cite> as:</p>
<p><blockquote>…a vivacious, shifting display of form and color….a tall, narrow image...fill[ing] just the segment of a large wall nearest the sidewalk and the street. The resulting painting may be read as a four-story stack of blue, yellow, orange, and burnt red cubic shapes aligned along a central spine or axis. Notably, the interlocking cubes seem to shift and flip (the artist describes them as "flippable forms"), alternately appearing solid and transparent, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, and receding and pushing forward. This continuous, restless interplay of geometry, space, and color conveys something of the flux and dynamic energy that underlies the seeming solidity and secure structure of the world.<a href="references.html"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote></p>

<p>(b.) In 1973, upon completion of <cite>Color Cubes</cite>, New Detroit, Inc. requests a poster-sized version of the painting for its downtown offices. Rubello paints one in acrylic and donates it.</p>
<p>In 2009, it is found by the author in the Russell Bazaar, a local junk shop.
