<h2>RICHARD MORTENSEN.</h2>
<p>Rubello's teacher at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1963-66 was a Danish painter (1910-1993) known for geometric abstraction.  His mantra, according to Rubello, was "Line, form, color."</p>

<p>While in school, Rubello and two fellow students appear on a Danish TV program, co-creating a messy, black-and-white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_painting">action painting </a>
. The next day, Rubello remembers that Mortensen, an "expansive, emotional guy," was irate. "That just wasn't the way he wanted us to paint."</p>
