<h2>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS. Â </h2>
<p>In 1965, the <a href="http://arts.gov/">NEA </a>
 is founded during the Johnson administration, "marking the first time in American history that substantial federal tax-based funds were allocated for arts spending at the state and local levels," according to art historian Cher Knight.<a href="references.html"><sup>7 </sup></a></p>
<p>One of its first efforts is a (now-defunct) program called Art in Public Places, which provides matching federal funds to support community-led public art initiatives. The first work created in the US using Art in Public Places funding is Alexander Calder's monumental 1969 sculpture <cite>La Grande Vitesse</cite> in Grand Rapids, MI.</p>

<p>In 1972, New Detroit Inc. successfully applies for $10,000 in Art in Public Places money to help fund the second year of the Living With Art program, which includes the commission of <cite>Color Cubes</cite>.<a href="references.html"><sup>6 </sup></a></p>
