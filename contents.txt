Located in the @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Boulevard_Historic_District,Washington Blvd. Historic District], for much of the 20th century a thriving neighborhood of shops and hotels, 1420 Washington has been known variously over the years as the Palmer Building (it was commissioned by @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Palmer,Senator Thomas W. Palmer], the Gardner & Schumacher Building, the Robinson Furniture Building, and the Fellowcraft Athletic Club Building. It was home, successively and for many decades, to two prominent furniture companies: Robinson and Gardner & Schumacher. Now primarily an office building and known as the Julian C. Madison Building, after the pioneering black architect, 1420 Washington has been owned since the mid-1980s after a period of vacancy by Sharon Madison-Polk, Julian C.

%h2 1973. 

Richard Nixon is inaugurated for his second term. US involvement in Vietnam ends. *Roe v. Wade* overturns states' bans on abortion. Thomas Pynchon publishes *Gravity's Rainbow*. The World Trade Center, designed by Detroit architect Minoru Yamasaki, opens in New York City. Picasso dies. 



The mayor of Detroit is Roman Gribbs. He serves one term and is preceded by Jerome Cavanaugh and succeeded by Coleman Young. 



In February, a committee called The Option Process Task Force, convened by Michigan governor William Milliken in 1972 to "examine the problems of the Detroit Metropolitan area and to recommend effective solutions to solving them," presents its findings in a @link[http://www.remappingdebate.org/sites/default/files/TOP%20Force%20Report%201973.pdf,report] that concludes the following:



^The Southeastern Michigan region is confronted with fundamental problems of increasing complexity and severity. The region possesses, among other things, excellent industrial and commercial development features, a large pool of skilled labor, renowned cultural and educational institutions, and vital communities in which to live. Like other urbanized areas, however, it is plagued by a lack of jobs (with concentrated unemployment pockets), poor public transportation facilities, concentrated sub-standard housing and segregated housing patterns, inadequate health care and recreational programs and facilities, fragmented social services and high crime rates, exacerbated by a corrections system which does not rehabilitate. These problems, at one time limited to the core city, are now having a rapidly expanding impact upon residents of adjacent and outlying communities of the region….#10^

%title ART IN ARCHITECTURE



%h2 *ART IN ARCHITECTURE.*

In 1968, Detroit architect, painter, and Rubello patron @link[http://www.michiganmodern.org/designers/louis-g-redstone,Louis Redstone] publishes a book that that advocates for, documents, and celebrates the intentional integration of artwork into and onto buildings. 



%img Art_in_Architecture



From its introduction:



^This book is written with a fervent hope that all the arts will take their rightful place again in the total environment of our reborn cities. The geometric patterns of our buildings, so characteristic of our machine-age period, more than ever before demand the human touch of the sculptor, the painter, and the craftsman….There is a continuous war to be fought against urban ugliness….Essential to this objective, I believe, is the integration of art in all of its forms in the daily life of the community.#11^ 



*Art in Architecture* is a work motivated by the passions of its author but is also a revealing artifact from a time of renewed interest in public art, a moment that "coincided with a period of widespread urban renewal" in the US, according to art historians Harriet Senie and Sally Webster:



"In 1966 the @link[http://www.michiganmodern.org/designers/louis-g-redstone,Model Cities Act] was passed, and a variety of local zoning ordinances offered bonuses to builders for the inclusion of open space….Public art became a part of urban renewal programs, as it had been in centuries past, functioning an emblem of culture and a manifestation of economic wealth…."#14 See @link[living_with_art,**LIVING WITH ART**] and @link[murals,**MURALS**]. 



%slug art_appreciation

%title ART APPRECIATION



%h2 ART APPRECIATION. 

To Rubello, a higher pursuit than art criticism. While the latter is a conversation between specialists, the former concerns the non-artist, the non-critic -- who too must live with art.



%slug art_public

%title ART, PUBLIC



%h2 ART, PUBLIC.

Is it art intended for the general public and sited somewhere accessible to the same? Is it, more narrowly, art that is funded by public money and sited on public land or in a publicly-owned building? Or is it something else?



"Clearly," write art historian Patricia C. Phillips, 



^...public art is not public just because it is out of doors, or in some identifiable civic space, or because it is something that almost everyone can apprehend; it is public because it is a manifestation of art activities and strategies that take the idea of the public as the genesis and subject for analysis. It is public because of the kinds of questions it chooses to ask or address, and not because of its accessibility or volume of viewers. This is, of course, a far more difficult and obscure definition of public art, and the methods and intentions of production and criticism are less predictable, more unruly. It requires a commitment to experimentation--to the belief that public art and public life are not fixed.#9^



It is worth noting that while the public never owned *Color Cubes*, we did help fund it. See @link[national_endowment,**NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS**] and @link[polk_sharon,**MADISON-POLK, SHARON**].



%slug blue_cut

%title BLUE CUT



%h2 *BLUE CUT.* 

Upon returning from a five-week trip to Rome to study perspective in 1978, Rubello begins considering the possibility that paintings might actually "come out from the wall." *Blue Cut*, a turning point in his career, is the first work he paints with this idea in mind.



%img Blue_Cut

%caption Blue Cut by David Rubello, 1978, […]



After making a first pass at the canvas, Rubello writes that he "broke up the atmospheric space and initiated a pure sky blue rectangle at the top right hand corner....This presented an implied separation from the picture plane. The blue rectangle created a blue cut interrupting the two dimensional plane. This pure color opposed the rest of the painting."#12



*Blue Cut* advances Rubello's concern with forms and spatial relationships evident in his earlier, more rigidly geometric paintings, like *Color Cubes*, and its implied dimensionality prefigures his later, literally three-dimensional paintings. See @link[painting_dimensional,**PAINTING, DIMENSIONAL**].



%slug color

%h2 COLOR. 

In a section of the city dominated by browns, blacks, and greys, the reds, blues, greens and yellow of *Color Cubes* surprised, seized, and delighted the eye, even after decades of wear and fading.



%img Color_Cubes_Faded

%caption Color Cubes in 2010. Photo by One More Spoke, http://onemorespoke.blogspot.com/ 



Perhaps nothing is more essential to Rubello's art than pure color (though he has made compelling work in black and white). There is a sense of joy and discovery in the boldness and confidence with which he wields and juxtaposes like colors, different colors, and shades of the same color. This is the joy of a passionate educator: Rubello taught color at the College for Creative Studies in the late 1990s, and it would not be incorrect to say that his work teaches its viewers about color. 



The German-born American artist @link[http://www.artnet.com/artists/josef-albers/,Josef Albers], whose work is a parent to Rubello's, writes in 1971 that color, "the most relative medium in art, has innumerable faces or appearances. To study them in their respective interactions, in their interdependence, will enrich our 'seeing,' our world -- and ourselves."#1 See @link[color_reflected,COLOR, REFLECTED].

It is painted over in May, 2014 after years of fading and wear.

Upon selecting the site for his mural and considering an appropriate design, Rubello revisits an earlier screenprint, Poetry of Space, and doubles it along its vertical axis. See @link[living_with_art, Living With Art].



%img Poetry_of_Space

%caption Poetry of Space, 1971, in an exhibition in Mt. Clemens, MI. Photographer unknown



*Color Cubes* is described by Dennis Nawrocki in the book *Art in Public Places* as:



^…a vivacious, shifting display of form and color….a tall, narrow image...fill[ing] just the segment of a large wall nearest the sidewalk and the street. The resulting painting may be read as a four-story stack of blue, yellow, orange, and burnt red cubic shapes aligned along a central spine or axis. Notably, the interlocking cubes seem to shift and flip (the artist describes them as "flippable forms"), alternately appearing solid and transparent, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, and receding and pushing forward. This continuous, restless interplay of geometry, space, and color conveys something of the flux and dynamic energy that underlies the seeming solidity and secure structure of the world.#4^

(b.) In 1973, upon completion of *Color Cubes*, New Detroit, Inc. requests a poster-sized version of the painting for its downtown offices. Rubello paints one in acrylic and donates it.



In 2009, it is found by the author in the Russell Bazaar, a local junk shop. See @link[1973,**1973**], @link[geometry_irrational,**GEOMETRY, IRRATIONAL**], @link[homage,**HOMAGE**], and@link[living_with_art,**LIVING WITH ART**].

"It glows," Rubello says about this device. "But I call it a fugitive thing because you either see it or you don't. It all has to do with the painting's relationship to light." See @link[painting_dimensional,**PAINTING, DIMENSIONAL**].

The society's school, offering a formal, four-year education in art, opens in its Brush Park headquarters in 1926.#2

On weekends in the early 1950s, the teenage Rubello takes the streetcar from his home on Detroit's east side to the school, where he studies drawing and painting. In 1955, after graduating from Cass Technical High School, he earns a scholarship to return to Arts & Crafts full-time. ("I showed up with one painting and showed it to Guy Palazolla, the assistant director. He showed it to Sarkus Sarkesian, the director, and I got the scholarship. I didn't have to fill out any paperwork or anything.") For one year, Rubello takes classes in painting and figure drawing from 9 am - 9 pm, Monday through Friday.

In 1958, the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts moves into a new building, designed by Minoru Yamasaki, in the city's cultural center. By 1975, it has expanded and become the Center for Creative Studies -- known today as the @link[http://www.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/,College for Creative Studies], a leading institution of art and design and education.

%slug dynamism

%title DYNAMISM



%h2 DYNAMISM.

Diane Kirkpatrick, professor of art at the University of Michigan in 1973, writes of Rubello's geometric paintings: 



^The back plane never reads as infinite space, but rather as a visual limit in front of which, and against which, the volumes act. The volumes also interact with each other; the relationships are never those of stasis, but rather those of implied movement as if Rubello in each piece had caught one moment in a fluid geometric dance….We are never permitted to settle comfortably, even for an instant, into one reading of the forms in space….The work of David Rubello introduces us to a magic world of shapes and space which becomes animated as we look at it.#13^

One reason that Rubello selects 1420 Washington for the site of Color Cubes is because he believes that the Empire Building will help protect his mural from the elements over time. It does so until the late 1990s, when it is razed for a parking lot.

In 1971, this sprawling downtown office building, designed by Albert Kahn and Wirt Rowland in the Neoclassical style and built between 1921 and 1930, becomes the site of *Message to Demar and Lauri*, downtown Detroit's first, large-scale geometric mural.



%img First_National_Building

%caption The First National is in the rear.



The same year that *Message to Demar and Lauri* is painted onto the First National, a solo show of David Rubello's work, including paintings as large as 4' x 8', inaugurates the building's new art gallery. (Rubello requests that the gallery's walls be painted black.) When he visits the gallery to drop off his paintings, the creation of *Message to Demar and Lauri* is in process and Rubello spends a few minutes chatting with the two mural painters, who are preparing to ascend.



Later that day, there is an accident and one of the painters falls 14 stories to the parking lot below. He survives, but is paralyzed for the rest of his life.

What is the relationship of David Rubello's work to geometry? *Color Cubes*, like many of his paintings from the 1960s and '70s, can be categorized as @link[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/hard-edge-painting.htm,"hard-edge"]," the generic child of @link[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geab/hd_geab.htm,geometric abstraction] and @link[http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=8,color field painting]: neat, depersonalized, anti-representational, unpainterly, concerned primarily with the interplay between clearly defined, pure color geometric forms.



%img Room

%caption Room, 197?, acrylic on canvas



But Rubello's geometry is an "irrational geometry," to borrow a phrase from Werner Spies' 1970 analysis of the work of Josef Albers. Spies might as well be referring to Rubello when he writes that Albers is, in fact,



^...not concerned with geometry. [He] is in search of forms which will pierce through the assurance of the geometric order. One could actually speak of geometric surrealism….The geometric play with perspective creates pictures which continuously collapse….



[He] provokes in the spectator an uncertainty by superimposing contrary interpretations which are mutually exclusive. The spectator remains uncertain--he is incapable of deciding in favor of one interpretation of the other. He may momentarily prefer one and may make an effort to concentrate on it. But as soon as this concentration diminishes, the picture offers him further, indecisive structures. This vacillating attempt to read the picture, the uncertainty and turbulence of perception--that is the actual content of the illustration.#15^  



%img Unknown_Title_1

%caption Photograph of a photograph by David Rubello. Original work: Unknown title, 1973, acrylic on canvas



Robert A. Yassin, assistant director of the University of Michigan Museum of Art in 1973, writes the following of Rubello's particular approach to geometric abstraction:



^Extraordinary variety is achieved within the narrow context of linear geometric projections and pure colors in simple combinations and subtle juxtapositions. The little shapes of color and line open up space, then suddenly close it, establishing at one and the same time the artificial perspective schema on the two-dimensional surface while destroying it and thus underscoring its artificiality. Although all his works are related stylistically to one another and proceed from the same theoretical base, each is unique, conceived independently from every other work, and each achieves its own interior rhythm and sense of balance of line and color.#13^

%slug living_with_art

%title LIVING WITH ART



%h2 "LIVING WITH ART."

In an attempt at neighborhood revitalization through public art making, the Arts Committee of New Detroit, Inc. creates the Living With Art initiative in 1971. It results in the creation of at least 12 outdoor murals, sculptures, and large indoor paintings by local artists in various Detroit neighborhoods in 1972 and 1973, including *Color Cubes*.



%img Arts_the_Thing

%caption From the Detroit Free Press, August 14, 1974



Living With Art's stated goals include the following:



"a.) To demonstrate the positive effect of art on the quality of life in the city through work created by local artists.

b.) To provide a showcase for area artists and encourage them to remain in Michigan.

c.) To stimulate neighborhoods to undertake continued improvement.

d.) To build a sense of pride in the community…."



A 1972 proposed program plan elaborates: 



^This project is aimed at one of the most demoralizing aspects of life for inner-city ghettos, the ugliness of their environment resulting from decades of neglect. While not presuming to initiate basic physical change in the neighborhoods selected, it seeks to demonstrate that beauty can be appreciated even in neglected areas, that it can have a positive effect on the quality of life in these areas, and that this evidence of interest and concern about neighborhood appearance will stimulate residents to initiate additional community improvement efforts.^



Living With Art is spearheaded by the late Gertrude Kasle, who at the time owns a well-known gallery ("exceptional," Rubello recalls) in the Fisher Building, and by Rubello's friend Charles McGee, a painter. It is championed by Mayor Gribbs, who lauds the effort to turn Detroit into a "city of art."



It results in the creation of the following, still extant works (all photos taken September-October, 2014):

Taking the long view of the neighborhood, she considers the erasure of the Rubello a positive, rather than negative, event -- an act not of removal but of restoration. She links it to downtown's ongoing revival, and to preparations for a new building she intends to erect on the parking lot just north of 1420 Washington, which would have obscured *Color Cubes*. She highlights the mural's decrepitude before its erasure. She appreciated Rubello's use of color but did not consider *Color Cubes* a significant work, seeing it instead as a decaying remnant of a failed attempt at urban renewal.

%title MURALS



%h2 MURALS.

There are walls in Detroit in 2014 that are crowded with murals. Mural making has become an accepted strategy to enliven urban spaces, whether neglected, stable, or in the process of revitalization. It is practiced by both fine and street artists, in a kaleidoscopic variety of styles. The works are often created at the request of community groups, sometimes with community members themselves @link[http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knightarts.org%2Fcommunity%2Fdetroit%2Fmaking-brixels-with-cedric-tai&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH7aJG_AKbVZnTTqyt2cSGJ0oRrfg,taking an active role] in their creation. They function as decoration, revitalization, declaration of life. As signs that mark distinct neighborhood identities. As community building opportunities. Detroit has truly become a "city of art," and the art, like the city, is sprawling, messy, complex, and multilayered.  



The genesis of this proliferation can be traced to the early 1970s, when the first organized efforts to paint large-scale murals on Detroit's buildings were undertaken. 



First came Art for Detroit, funded by Detroit Renaissance in 1971 and resulting in the creation of three works: Alan Loving's lost *Message to Demar and Lauri*, Aris Koutroulis's lost *Poetic Electricity* on the Broadway Capital Building, and John Egner's still extant but partially obscured and compromised mural *Untitled* on the north wall of the Park Shelton.



In a letter dated March 3, 1971, Thomas Reid, president of Detroit Renaissance, explains the purpose and provenance of the program to Peter Dora, owner of a company called the Berenson Corporation that is apparently headquartered in the Cadillac Square Apartments:



^In line with our twin goals of promoting economic development in Detroit and revitalizing a widespread civic spirit, Detroit Renaissance has become involved with a very interesting and unusual project….Early last December, Lee Hills, publisher of the *Detroit Free Press* and president of the Detroit Arts Commission, suggested that paintings on the bare, drab, outside walls of some downtown buildings would give a visible lift to our city….^



Inspired by the generally positive reaction garnered by Art for Detroit, the Arts Committee of New Detroit, Inc. begins work on Living With Art in 1971, adding public sculptural works to the mix. Arts Committee members drive around the city looking for potential mural sites and write letters asking property owners to allow their buildings to become adorned at no cost.



Reaction is not always favorable. On October 15, 1971, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company president Ralph T. McElvenny writes to Richard Richards, New Detroit's division director of Housing, Recreation, Youth and Arts:



^I do have substantial reservations about the paintings of murals on the sides of our downtown buildings. To me, this represents little more than hanging up a great billboard and I believe that the thinking of the public generally has very definitely progressed to the point where billboards are regarded more as an eyesore than anything else, particularly on our highways, and that they have little esthetic quality of appeal in our cities. 



I know it will be said that the murals on our buildings will be carefully selected and done by reputable artists, etc., but I think it takes little imagination to visualize what these murals may look like after a few of our typical winters have passed over them. To me, [this] proposal could well result in inflicting upon Detroit, an ancient city with a proud heritage, some of the junky aspects of Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Coney Island.



…Painting the outside walls of our downtown buildings…will detract from, rather than enhance, the appearance and cultural standing of our city.#5^



But doubts like McElvenny's are overshadowed by enthusiasm. Shortly after their creation, both Art for Detroit's and New Detroit's murals ("the first murals on the outside walls of Detroit's buildings") earn the approval of the *Detroit Free Press* art critic (and, later, founding director of MOCAD) Marsha Miro, who writes in 1974:



^Those who have judged and will continue to judge the success of these murals ('They're cool,' 'They start me dreaming,' 'They cheer me up,') are the nearby parking lot attendants, bus drivers, business people, and residents, as well as the artists and art critics, for the murals have not only provided a marvelous aesthetic face-lift for the hard bricks and mortar they cover, but, more important, they have made art, and good art at that, part of the everyday scene.#7^ 



The early '70s murals, funded by development organizations with big dreams and deep pockets, created to engender civic pride and promote economic development, are almost all gone or badly deteriorated. Often placed up high, designed by gifted fine artists in larger-than-life experiments that reflect both personal style and the aesthetic concerns of the day, they must have seemed, at one time, like they were meant to last. But where they still exist, as Ralph McElvenny predicted, they decay. (New Detroit's sculptural commissions have fared much better.)



More recent murals, often painted at street level and created in a time when the distinction between fine and street art has worn away, do not seem to reach as high as works like *Color Cubes* and *Message for Demar and Lauri* did. But perhaps they reflect, as Patricia C. Phillips puts it, "a more passionate commitment to the temporary" that is better suited to the inconstant urban environment. They do not seem to suffer from the misconception, in other words, that they are meant to last.

In 1965, the @link[http://arts.gov/,NEA] is founded during the Johnson administration, "marking the first time in American history that substantial federal tax-based funds were allocated for arts spending at the state and local levels," according to art historian Cher Knight.#6 One of its first efforts is a (now-defunct) program called Art in Public Places, which provides matching federal funds to support community-led public art initiatives. The first work created in the US using Art in Public Places funding is Alexander Calder's monumental sculpture *La Grande Vitesse* in Grand Rapids, MI.

"The broad purpose of New Detroit, Inc.," according to a program proposal from 1972, "is to address itself to the problems of the disadvantaged and alienated people in this urban area…It seeks to resolve these problems by bringing about desirable and necessary social change and by supporting and encouraging initiative arising in the black community."#5

The scope of New Detroit's efforts in its early days is staggering. Committee members work on issues in education, employment, health, housing, youth development, economic development, public safety, justice, business development, community services, drug abuse, and art. 



Why art?



A 1972 New Detroit Policy Statement on Black Culture explains:



^To some, the proposal seems strange the a high priority should be given to culture at a time when the struggle to provide the bare survival needs of inner city residents such as housing and jobs is acute. The struggle in which our city is engaged today is a struggle to create a community which enables all of its residents to lead rewarding and meaningful lives. Such an effort must include concern for those experiences which give to the individual a sense of orientation to life and of his unique value in his society. This is the special role of what we call culture.



New Detroit takes the following position with respect to the support of efforts designed to broaden contact and understanding across racial and economic lines.



It believes that while some issues can be resolved through direction confrontation, many conflicts can be more effectively reduced through voluntary participation by persons of differing social and economic backgrounds in shared experiences which enrich all the participants.



It also believes that the arts - drama, painting, music - provide one of the important avenues for positive communication among persons of many differing backgrounds.#5^

%h2 NIXON, RICHARD.

From his 1971 address to the Associated Council of the Arts, urging Congress to increase federal support for the arts:



^We can spend billions on new scientific miracles, on education, on housing, on health care, highways and airports and all the other goods and services that Government is expected to provide -- and in doing so we can meet very genuine needs and discharge very real responsibilities. But this alone would be like designing a violin without the strings. 



As we look ahead, 10, 20, 30 years, we can chart the prospect of many great achievements. We have seen technological advance speed up by almost a geometrical progression; already we take moon landings almost for granted. Computers, industrial advances, agricultural breakthroughs, all are multiplying the goods and services our economy can produce.



These material advances are important. They extend man's reach; they widen our range of choices; they make it possible to look ahead toward an end to hunger and misery and disease not only in America but elsewhere in the world as well.



But by themselves those advances can never be enough. The engineers and the scientists can take us to the moon, but we need the poet or the painter to take us to the heights of understanding and perception. Doctors are enabling us to live longer and healthier lives, but we need the musician and the dancer and the filmmaker to bring beauty and meaning to our lives.#16^ 



In his 2010 blog post @link[http://onemorespoke.blogspot.com/2010/06/detroits-geometric-murals-of-seventies.html,"Detroit's Geometric Murals of the Seventies"] Detroit blogger @link[http://onemorespoke.blogspot.com/,One More Spoke] writes of the 37th president:



"Richard Nixon can usually be blamed for most things. Geometric murals of the 1970s are no exception. Not to say he should be blamed in a bad way, just to say his presidency and ultimate resignation resulted in a need to think in shapes. The shapes were a panacea for war and scandal. Subliminally his presence is still felt though. NIXON is the most geometric name of any president we've ever had, so it's no surprise that this style of mural was de rigueur during, and soon after, the Watergate era."#8 See @link[1973,**1973**].

"In about 1981," Rubello says, "I began to leave painting. I thought, 'Well, the next move has to be out from the wall. It has to be out from the canvas. And instead of making it illusionistic [as in Blue Cut], I should actually do it. It should be color in space.' So I started constructing these things, making these paintings that were dimensional. I called it 'actual space.'"

Rubello's turn toward dimensional paintings opens up the possibility of working with reflected color and movable paintings. It also advances his concern with illusionistic play; often, his dimensional works contain brilliant, saturated colors that are invisible from certain perspectives, revealed only after the viewer has physically moved around them. See @link[blue_cut,**BLUE CUT**], @link[color_reflected,**COLOR, REFLECTED**], and @link[moveables,**MOVABLES**].

Here is a recording of Rubello reading a poem he wrote for Kurt Schwitters, the eccentric German collage artist who incorporated scraps of paper from the streets into his work:
