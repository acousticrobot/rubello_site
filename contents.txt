In February, a committee called The Option Process Task Force, convened by Michigan governor William Milliken in 1972 to "examine the problems of the Detroit Metropolitan area and to recommend effective solutions to solving them," presents its findings in a @link[http://www.remappingdebate.org/sites/default/files/TOP%20Force%20Report%201973.pdf,report] that concludes the following:

^The Southeastern Michigan region is confronted with fundamental problems of increasing complexity and severity. The region possesses, among other things, excellent industrial and commercial development features, a large pool of skilled labor, renowned cultural and educational institutions, and vital communities in which to live. Like other urbanized areas, however, it is plagued by a lack of jobs (with concentrated unemployment pockets), poor public transportation facilities, concentrated sub-standard housing and segregated housing patterns, inadequate health care and recreational programs and facilities, fragmented social services and high crime rates, exacerbated by a corrections system which does not rehabilitate. These problems, at one time limited to the core city, are now having a rapidly expanding impact upon residents of adjacent and outlying communities of the region….#11^

In April 2014, the first 7-Eleven store to operate in Detroit in eleven years opens on Jefferson Ave., east of downtown. In anticipation of its opening and the subsequent opening of a second store downtown, large banner ads featuring photo collages of different animals wearing Slurpee mustache straws appear on several downtown buildings, including one, featuring a cat, on the north exterior wall of the Julian C.

%h2 *ART IN ARCHITECTURE.*
In 1968, Detroit architect, painter, and Rubello patron @link[http://www.michiganmodern.org/designers/louis-g-redstone,Louis Redstone] publishes a book that that advocates for, documents, and celebrates the intentional integration of artwork into and onto buildings. 

%img Art_in_Architecture

From its introduction:

^This book is written with a fervent hope that all the arts will take their rightful place again in the total environment of our reborn cities. The geometric patterns of our buildings, so characteristic of our machine-age period, more than ever before demand the human touch of the sculptor, the painter, and the craftsman….There is a continuous war to be fought against urban ugliness….Essential to this objective, I believe, is the integration of art in all of its forms in the daily life of the community.#12^ 

*Art in Architecture* is a work motivated by the passions of its author but is also a revealing artifact from a time of renewed interest in public art, a moment that "coincided with a period of widespread urban renewal" in the US, according to art historians Harriet Senie and Sally Webster:

"In 1966 the @link[http://www.michiganmodern.org/designers/louis-g-redstone,Model Cities Act] was passed, and a variety of local zoning ordinances offered bonuses to builders for the inclusion of open space….Public art became a part of urban renewal programs, as it had been in centuries past, functioning an emblem of culture and a manifestation of economic wealth…."#15

Inspired by the English @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement,Arts and Crafts movement] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, local civic leaders found the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts 1906 in order to promote the ideals of beauty and craftsmanship in an increasingly industrial age. The society's school, offering a formal, four-year education in art, opens in its Brush Park headquarters in 1926.#3

On weekends in the early 1950s, the teenage Rubello takes the streetcar from his home on Detroit's east side to the school, where he studies drawing and painting. In 1955, after graduating from Cass Technical High School, he earns a scholarship to return to Arts & Crafts full-time. ("I showed up with one painting and showed it to Guy Palazolla, the assistant director. He showed it to Sarkus Sarkesian, the director, and I got the scholarship. I didn't have to fill out any paperwork or anything.") For one year, Rubello takes classes in painting and figure drawing from 9 am - 9 pm, Monday through Friday.

%img Color_Cubes_Faded
%caption Color Cubes in 2010. Photo by One More Spoke, http://onemorespoke.blogspot.com/ 

Perhaps nothing is more essential to *Color Cubes*, and to Rubello's art in general, than pure color (though he has made compelling work in black and white). There is a sense of joy and discovery in the boldness and confidence with which he wields and juxtaposes like colors, different colors, and shades of the same color. This is the joy of a passionate educator: Rubello taught color at the College for Creative Studies in the late 1990s, and it would not be incorrect to say that his work teaches its viewers about color. 

The artist @link[http://www.artnet.com/artists/josef-albers/,Josef Albers], whose work is a parent to Rubello's, writes in 1971 that color, "the most relative medium in art, has innumerable faces or appearances. To study them in their respective interactions, in their interdependence, will enrich our 'seeing,' our world -- and ourselves."#1 

Rubello's later forays into three-dimensional painting and sculpture lead to him a new way of thinking about and working with color: by placing a colored surface very near and at a right angle to a white surface, a subtle, colored shadow is cast upon the latter.

%img Illuminated_Column
%caption Illuminated Column, 1973, acrylic on wood

"It glows," Rubello says about this device, which he refers to as "reflected color." 

"But I call it a fugitive thing because you either see it or you don't. It all has to do with the painting's relationship to light." 

Here is a recording of Rubello reading an original poem inspired by the eccentric German collage artist @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schwitters,Kurt Schwitters]'s use of colored paper:

%img Poetry_of_Space
%caption Poetry of Space, 1971, in an exhibition in Mt. Clemens, MI. Photographer unknown

*Color Cubes* is described by art historian Dennis Nawrocki in the book *Art in Public Places* as:

^…a vivacious, shifting display of form and color….a tall, narrow image...fill[ing] just the segment of a large wall nearest the sidewalk and the street. The resulting painting may be read as a four-story stack of blue, yellow, orange, and burnt red cubic shapes aligned along a central spine or axis. Notably, the interlocking cubes seem to shift and flip (the artist describes them as "flippable forms"), alternately appearing solid and transparent, two-dimensional and three-dimensional, and receding and pushing forward. This continuous, restless interplay of geometry, space, and color conveys something of the flux and dynamic energy that underlies the seeming solidity and secure structure of the world.#5^

(b.) In 1973, upon completion of *Color Cubes*, New Detroit, Inc. requests a poster-sized version of the painting for its downtown offices. Rubello paints one in acrylic and donates it.

In 2009, it is found by the author in the Russell Bazaar, a local junk shop.

One reason that Rubello selects 1420 Washington for the site of Color Cubes is because he believes that the Empire Building will help protect his mural from the elements over time. It does so until the late 1990s, when it is razed for a parking lot.

(Rubello requests that the gallery's walls be painted black.) When he visits the gallery to drop off his paintings, the creation of *Message to Demar and Lauri* is in process and Rubello spends a few minutes chatting with the two mural painters as they prepare to ascend.

Later that day, there is an accident and one of the painters falls, Rubello recalls, 14 stories to the parking lot below. He survives, but is paralyzed for the rest of his life.

What is the relationship of David Rubello's work to geometry? *Color Cubes*, like many of his paintings from the 1960s and '70s, can be categorized as @link[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/hard-edge-painting.htm,"hard-edge"]," the generic child of @link[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geab/hd_geab.htm,geometric abstraction] and @link[http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=8,color field painting]: neat, depersonalized, anti-representational, unpainterly, concerned primarily with the interplay between clearly defined, pure color geometric forms.

%img Room
%caption Room (from Measured Space series), 1970, acrylic on canvas

But Rubello's geometry is an "irrational geometry," to borrow a phrase from Werner Spies' @link[http://www.amazon.com/Josef-Albers-Art-Werner-Spies/dp/0500220115,1970 analysis of the work of Josef Albers]. Spies might as well be referring to Rubello when he writes that Albers is, in fact,

^…not concerned with geometry. [He] is in search of forms which will pierce through the assurance of the geometric order. One could actually speak of geometric surrealism….The geometric play with perspective creates pictures which continuously collapse….<br><br>[He] provokes in the spectator an uncertainty by superimposing contrary interpretations which are mutually exclusive. The spectator remains uncertain--he is incapable of deciding in favor of one interpretation of the other. He may momentarily prefer one and may make an effort to concentrate on it. But as soon as this concentration diminishes, the picture offers him further, indecisive structures. This vacillating attempt to read the picture, the uncertainty and turbulence of perception--that is the actual content of the illustration.#16^  

%img Unknown_Title_1
%caption Photograph of a photograph by David Rubello. Original work: Unknown title, 1973, acrylic on canvas

Robert A. Yassin, assistant director of the University of Michigan Museum of Art in 1973, writes the following of Rubello's particular approach to geometric abstraction:

^Extraordinary variety is achieved within the narrow context of linear geometric projections and pure colors in simple combinations and subtle juxtapositions. The little shapes of color and line open up space, then suddenly close it, establishing at one and the same time the artificial perspective schema on the two-dimensional surface while destroying it and thus underscoring its artificiality. Although all his works are related stylistically to one another and proceed from the same theoretical base, each is unique, conceived independently from every other work, and each achieves its own interior rhythm and sense of balance of line and color.#14^

%h2 "LIVING WITH ART."
In an attempt to revitalize Detroit neighborhoods through public art making, the Arts Committee of New Detroit, Inc. establishes the Living With Art initiative in 1971. It results in the creation of at least 12 outdoor murals, sculptures, and large indoor paintings by local artists in various Detroit neighborhoods in 1972 and 1973, including *Color Cubes*.

%img Arts_the_Thing
%caption From the Detroit Free Press, August 14, 1974

Living With Art's stated goals include the following:

"a.) To demonstrate the positive effect of art on the quality of life in the city through work created by local artists.
b.) To provide a showcase for area artists and encourage them to remain in Michigan.
c.) To stimulate neighborhoods to undertake continued improvement.
d.) To build a sense of pride in the community…."

A 1972 proposed program plan elaborates: 

^This project is aimed at one of the most demoralizing aspects of life for inner-city ghettos, the ugliness of their environment resulting from decades of neglect. While not presuming to initiate basic physical change in the neighborhoods selected, it seeks to demonstrate that beauty can be appreciated even in neglected areas, that it can have a positive effect on the quality of life in these areas, and that this evidence of interest and concern about neighborhood appearance will stimulate residents to initiate additional community improvement efforts.^

Living With Art is spearheaded by the late Gertrude Kasle, who at the time owns a well-known gallery ("exceptional," Rubello recalls) in the Fisher Building, and by Rubello's friend Charles McGee, a painter. It is championed by Mayor Gribbs, who lauds the effort to turn Detroit into a "city of art."

It results in the creation of the following, still extant works (all photos taken September-October, 2014):

Taking the long view of the neighborhood, she considers the erasure of the Rubello a positive, rather than negative, event -- an act not of removal but of restoration. She links it to downtown's ongoing revival, and to preparations for a new building she intends to erect on the parking lot just north of 1420 Washington, which would have obscured *Color Cubes*. She highlights the mural's decrepitude before its erasure. She appreciated Rubello's use of color but did not consider *Color Cubes* a significant work, seeing it instead as a decaying remnant of a failed attempt at urban renewal.

Diane Kirkpatrick, professor of art at the University of Michigan in 1973, writes the following about Rubello's early '70s geometric paintings, including *Color Cubes*: 

^The back plane never reads as infinite space, but rather as a visual limit in front of which, and against which, the volumes act. The volumes also interact with each other; the relationships are never those of stasis, but rather those of implied movement as if Rubello in each piece had caught one moment in a fluid geometric dance….We are never permitted to settle comfortably, even for an instant, into one reading of the forms in space….The work of David Rubello introduces us to a magic world of shapes and space which becomes animated as we look at it.#14^

Later in his career, after he begins to explore the possibilities of dimensional painting, Rubello's art becomes more literally kinetic. His "movables" are three-dimensional paintings and sculptures made of wood that incorporate one or more movable parts, allowing for variable configurations.

"You can change this," Rubello explains as he demonstrates one. "It's a different painting each time. You can decide what you want to look at each day." 

Below is a video excerpt showing some of Rubello's movable paintings in action:

Detroit in 2014 is rich with @link[http://motorcitymuckraker.com/2014/10/17/mural-crackdown-could-have-spelled-trouble-for-these-30-murals/,murals]. The act of mural making has become increasingly popular here as a strategy to enliven urban spaces, whether neglected, stable, or in the process of revitalization.

The murals function as both decoration and declaration of life. As signs that help shape distinct neighborhood identities. As attempts to build and strengthen communities. Detroit has truly become a "city of art," and the art, like the city, is sprawling, messy, variable.

The genesis of this proliferation can be traced, in part, to the early 1970s, when the first organized efforts to paint large-scale murals on Detroit's buildings were undertaken. 

First came Art for Detroit, funded by the nonprofit development organization Detroit Renaissance in 1971 and resulting in the creation of three works: Alan Loving's lost *Message to Demar and Lauri*, Aris Koutroulis's lost *Poetic Electricity* on the Broadway Capital Building, and John Egner's still extant but partially obscured and compromised mural *Untitled* on the north wall of the Park Shelton.

In a letter dated March 3, 1971, Thomas Reid, president of Detroit Renaissance, explains the purpose and provenance of the program to Peter Dora, owner of a company called the Berenson Corporation that is apparently headquartered in the Cadillac Square Apartments:

^In line with our twin goals of promoting economic development in Detroit and revitalizing a widespread civic spirit, Detroit Renaissance has become involved with a very interesting and unusual project….Early last December, Lee Hills, publisher of the *Detroit Free Press* and president of the Detroit Arts Commission, suggested that paintings on the bare, drab, outside walls of some downtown buildings would give a visible lift to our city….^

Inspired by the generally positive reaction garnered by Art for Detroit, the Arts Committee of New Detroit, Inc. begins work on Living With Art in 1971, adding public sculptural works to the mix. Arts Committee members drive around the city looking for potential mural sites and write letters asking property owners to allow their buildings to become adorned at no cost.

Reaction is not always favorable. On October 15, 1971, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company president Ralph T. McElvenny writes to Richard Richards, New Detroit's division director of Housing, Recreation, Youth and Arts:

^I do have substantial reservations about the paintings of murals on the sides of our downtown buildings. To me, this represents little more than hanging up a great billboard and I believe that the thinking of the public generally has very definitely progressed to the point where billboards are regarded more as an eyesore than anything else, particularly on our highways, and that they have little esthetic quality of appeal in our cities.<br><br>I know it will be said that the murals on our buildings will be carefully selected and done by reputable artists, etc., but I think it takes little imagination to visualize what these murals may look like after a few of our typical winters have passed over them. To me, [this] proposal could well result in inflicting upon Detroit, an ancient city with a proud heritage, some of the junky aspects of Hollywood, Los Angeles, and Coney Island.<br><br>…Painting the outside walls of our downtown buildings…will detract from, rather than enhance, the appearance and cultural standing of our city.#6^

But doubts like McElvenny's are overshadowed by enthusiasm. Shortly after their creation, both Art for Detroit's and New Detroit's murals ("the first murals on the outside walls of Detroit's buildings") earn the approval of the *Detroit Free Press* art critic (and, later, founding director of MOCAD) Marsha Miro, who writes in 1974:

^Those who have judged and will continue to judge the success of these murals ("They're cool," "They start me dreaming," "They cheer me up,") are the nearby parking lot attendants, bus drivers, business people, and residents, as well as the artists and art critics, for the murals have not only provided a marvelous aesthetic face-lift for the hard bricks and mortar they cover, but, more important, they have made art, and good art at that, part of the everyday scene.#8^ 

The early '70s murals, funded by development organizations with big dreams and deep pockets, created to engender civic pride and promote economic revitalization, are almost all gone or badly deteriorated. 

Often placed up high, designed by gifted fine artists in precise, larger-than-life experiments that reflect both personal style and the aesthetic concerns of the day, they must have seemed, for a time, eternal. Monumental. But the economic situation in Detroit only worsened, and where they still exist, as Ralph McElvenny predicted, the murals decay. (New Detroit's sculptural commissions have fared much better.)

More recent murals, created in a time of prolonged economic depression, when the distinction between fine and street art has eroded, do not seem to reach as high as works like *Color Cubes* and *Message for Demar and Lauri* did. They are often painted, in fact, at street level, where they're susceptible to vandalism (or modification by others artists.)

But perhaps they reflect, as Patricia C. Phillips puts it, "a more passionate commitment to the temporary" that is better suited to the inconstant urban environment. They do not seem to suffer from the misconception, in other words, that they are meant to last.

In 1965, the @link[http://arts.gov/,NEA] is founded during the Johnson administration, "marking the first time in American history that substantial federal tax-based funds were allocated for arts spending at the state and local levels," according to art historian Cher Knight.#7 One of its first efforts is a (now-defunct) program called Art in Public Places, which provides matching federal funds to support community-led public art initiatives. The first work created in the US using Art in Public Places funding is Alexander Calder's monumental sculpture *La Grande Vitesse* in Grand Rapids, MI.

"The broad purpose of New Detroit, Inc.," according to a program proposal from 1972, "is to address itself to the problems of the disadvantaged and alienated people in this urban area…It seeks to resolve these problems by bringing about desirable and necessary social change and by supporting and encouraging initiative arising in the black community."#6 

New Detroit remains an active force in the city to this day, its mission to improve race relations and advance social and economic equity pursued through a variety of @link[http://www.newdetroit.org/cms/index.php/programs-events,programs and events].

The scope of New Detroit's efforts in its early days is staggering. Committee members work on issues in education, employment, health, housing, youth development, economic development, public safety, justice, business development, community services, drug abuse, and art.#6 

Why art?

A 1972 New Detroit Policy Statement on Black Culture explains:

^To some, the proposal seems strange the a high priority should be given to culture at a time when the struggle to provide the bare survival needs of inner city residents such as housing and jobs is acute. The struggle in which our city is engaged today is a struggle to create a community which enables all of its residents to lead rewarding and meaningful lives. Such an effort must include concern for those experiences which give to the individual a sense of orientation to life and of his unique value in his society. This is the special role of what we call culture.<br><br>New Detroit takes the following position with respect to the support of efforts designed to broaden contact and understanding across racial and economic lines.<br><br>It believes that while some issues can be resolved through direction confrontation, many conflicts can be more effectively reduced through voluntary participation by persons of differing social and economic backgrounds in shared experiences which enrich all the participants.<br><br>It also believes that the arts - drama, painting, music - provide one of the important avenues for positive communication among persons of many differing backgrounds.#6^

From his 1971 address to the Associated Council of the Arts, urging Congress to increase federal support for the arts:

^We can spend billions on new scientific miracles, on education, on housing, on health care, highways and airports and all the other goods and services that Government is expected to provide -- and in doing so we can meet very genuine needs and discharge very real responsibilities. But this alone would be like designing a violin without the strings.<br><br>As we look ahead, 10, 20, 30 years, we can chart the prospect of many great achievements. We have seen technological advance speed up by almost a geometrical progression; already we take moon landings almost for granted. Computers, industrial advances, agricultural breakthroughs, all are multiplying the goods and services our economy can produce.<br><br>These material advances are important. They extend man's reach; they widen our range of choices; they make it possible to look ahead toward an end to hunger and misery and disease not only in America but elsewhere in the world as well.<br><br>But by themselves those advances can never be enough. The engineers and the scientists can take us to the moon, but we need the poet or the painter to take us to the heights of understanding and perception. Doctors are enabling us to live longer and healthier lives, but we need the musician and the dancer and the filmmaker to bring beauty and meaning to our lives.#17^ 

In the 2010 blog post @link[http://onemorespoke.blogspot.com/2010/06/detroits-geometric-murals-of-seventies.html,"Detroit's Geometric Murals of the Seventies"] blogger @link[http://onemorespoke.blogspot.com/,One More Spoke] writes the following of the 37th president:

^Richard Nixon can usually be blamed for most things. Geometric murals of the 1970s are no exception. Not to say he should be blamed in a bad way, just to say his presidency and ultimate resignation resulted in a need to think in shapes. The shapes were a panacea for war and scandal. Subliminally his presence is still felt though. NIXON is the most geometric name of any president we've ever had, so it's no surprise that this style of mural was de rigueur during, and soon after, the Watergate era.#^9

%title PERCEPTION

%h1 PERCEPTION.
What is the relationship of Rubello's work to optical illusion? Optical illusions, which explore the tendency of the mind to complete the incomplete, prioritize a kind of revelation, but in *Color Cubes*, nothing, finally, is made clear. Its truth is flux, not revelation. The cubes are never really cubes at all. The "a-ha" is transfigured into a kind of suspended, electric awareness. 

But Rubello's art shares with illusion a special concern for the magic acts made possible by visual perception.

"The works of David Rubello," writes Diane Kirkpatrick, "express the wonder of human perception….They experiment with two-dimensional space, three-dimensional space, and the wondrous world of illusionism for the painter in the interplay between the two."#14

The quality of perceptual play or "flippability" in *Color Cubes* and its cousins has antecedents in 20th century art (@link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher,Escher], @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Albers,Albers], a host of @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op_art,Op artists]), but Rubello traces it much farther back: to ancient Roman mosaics he first encountered in the early 1960s.

%title PERSPECTIVE

%h2 PERSPECTIVE.
In 1978, Rubello earns a Ford Foundation grant to spend five weeks in Italy studying the history of @link[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical),perspective]. Upon his return to the US, he begins considering the possibility that paintings might actually "come out from the wall." *Blue Cut*, a turning point in his career, is the first work he paints with this idea in mind.

%img Blue_Cut
%caption Blue Cut, 1978, acrylic on canvas

After making a first, painterly pass at the canvas, Rubello writes that he "broke up the atmospheric space and initiated a pure sky blue rectangle at the top right hand corner....This presented an implied separation from the picture plane. The blue rectangle created a blue cut interrupting the two dimensional plane. This pure color opposed the rest of the painting."#13

*Blue Cut* advances Rubello's concern with the relationships between geometric forms evident in his earlier, hard-edge paintings, like *Color Cubes*; it also anticipates his venture, three years later, into literal three-dimensionality.

"In about 1981," he says, "I began to leave painting. I thought, 'Well, the next move has to be out from the wall. It has to be out from the canvas. And instead of making it illusionistic [as in Blue Cut], I should actually do it. It should be color in space.' So I started constructing these things, making these paintings that were dimensional. I called it 'actual space.'"

%img Foyel
%caption Foyel, 1999, acrylic on wood

Rubello's turn toward "dimensional paintings" opens up the possibility of working with reflected color and movable paintings. It also provides new opportunities to engage in illusionistic play; often, his dimensional pieces contain brilliant, saturated colors that are invisible from certain perspectives, revealed only after the viewer has physically moved around the work.

%title PUBLIC ART

%h2 PUBLIC ART.
Is it art intended for the general public and sited somewhere accessible to the same? Is it, more narrowly, art that is funded by public money and sited on public land or in a publicly-owned building? Or is it something else?

"Clearly," write art historian Patricia C. Phillips, 

^...public art is not public just because it is out of doors, or in some identifiable civic space, or because it is something that almost everyone can apprehend; it is public because it is a manifestation of art activities and strategies that take the idea of the public as the genesis and subject for analysis. It is public because of the kinds of questions it chooses to ask or address, and not because of its accessibility or volume of viewers. This is, of course, a far more difficult and obscure definition of public art, and the methods and intentions of production and criticism are less predictable, more unruly. It requires a commitment to experimentation--to the belief that public art and public life are not fixed.#10^

It is worth noting here that while the public never owned *Color Cubes*, we did help fund it.
