<h2><cite>BLUE CUT.</cite></h2>
<p>Upon returning from a five-week trip to Italy to study perspective in 1978, Rubello begins considering the possibility that paintings might actually "come out from the wall." <cite>Blue Cut</cite>, a turning point in his career, is the first work he paints with this idea in mind.</p>

<p>After making a first pass at the canvas, Rubello writes that he "broke up the atmospheric space and initiated a pure sky blue rectangle at the top right hand corner....This presented an implied separation from the picture plane. The blue rectangle created a blue cut interrupting the two dimensional plane. This pure color opposed the rest of the painting."<a href="references.html"><sup>12 </sup></a></p>
<p><cite>Blue Cut</cite> advances Rubello's concern with forms and spatial relationships evident in his earlier, more rigidly geometric paintings, like <cite>Color Cubes</cite>, and its implied dimensionality prefigures his later, literally three-dimensional paintings.</p>
