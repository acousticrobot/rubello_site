<h2>HOMAGE.</h2>
<p>Upon learning of the erasure of <cite>Color Cubes</cite>, Detroiter, math teacher, and local public art enthusiast Melissa Francese paints a six foot tall version of it onto the wall of her Lafayette Park dining room.</p>
<img src="img/Homage.jpg" alt="Homage"><p>"It makes me want to cry that it's gone," she says. "I lived downtown four years ago. I would see it a lot on bike rides and it was one of the things I always showed my friends who came to visit. I missed it when it was painted over and I wanted to be able to see it, so I painted my own. I tried to get the colors right but it was challenging -- I had to change it up a bit."</p>
