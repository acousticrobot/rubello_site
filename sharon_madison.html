<h2>SHARON MADISON.</h2>
<p>The owner of 1420 Washington Blvd. since the mid-1980s, Madison is an architect, activist, urbanist, preservationist, and entrepreneur, as well as a contemporary art collector and a champion of "the art of the building."</p>

<p>1420 Washington was vacant when she bought it and she has remained active and invested in the neighborhood since, leading efforts to declare it a historic district and to restore the original streetscape after the installation of a controversial "pedestrian mall" in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Taking the long view of the neighborhood, she considers the erasure of the Rubello a positive, rather than negative, event -- an act not of removal but of restoration. She links it to downtown's ongoing revival, and to preparations for a new building she intends to erect on the parking lot just north of 1420 Washington, which would have obscured <cite>Color Cubes</cite>. She highlights the mural's decrepitude before its erasure. She appreciated Rubello's use of color but did not consider <cite>Color Cubes</cite> a significant work, seeing it instead as a decaying remnant of a failed attempt at urban renewal. "Until now," she says, "no one ever walked in my door and told me that they cared about it."</p>
