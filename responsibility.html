<h2>RESPONSIBILITY.</h2>
<p>Now (too late), a question emerges: who was responsible for <cite>Color Cubes</cite>? New Detroit, Inc., which commissioned and financed it? David Rubello, who created it? Sharon Madison-Polk, who bought the building onto which it was painted but never really cared for it? Those of us who admired it but watched it weather?</p>
