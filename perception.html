<h2>PERCEPTION.</h2>
<p>What is the relationship of Rubello's work to optical illusion? Optical illusions, which explore the tendency of the mind to complete the incomplete, prioritize a kind of revelation, but in <cite>Color Cubes</cite>, nothing, finally, is made clear. Its truth is flux, not revelation. The cubes are never really cubes at all. The "a-ha" is transfigured into a kind of suspended, electric awareness.</p>
<p>But Rubello's art shares with illusion a special concern for the magic acts made possible by visual perception.</p>
<p>"The works of David Rubello," writes Diane Kirkpatrick, "express the wonder of human perceptionâ€¦.They experiment with two-dimensional space, three-dimensional space, and the wondrous world of illusionism for the painter in the interplay between the two."<a href="references.html"><sup>14 </sup></a></p>

<p>The quality of perceptual play or "flippability" in <cite>Color Cubes</cite> and its cousins has antecedents in 20th century art (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">Escher </a>

), but Rubello traces it much farther back: to ancient Roman mosaics he first encountered in the early 1960s.</p>
